## Our Project

Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent kind of dementia and a fatal brain ailment. 
More study into this illness might lead to a better understanding of the condition and more effective treatment options. 
This projects' aim is to analyze publicly available RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data from human brain samples 
in order to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the presence or absence of Alzheimer's disease.

Our project is inspired by the paper
Nativio R, Lan Y, Donahue G et al. ["An integrated multi-omics approach identifies
epigenetic alterations associated with Alzheimer’s disease."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8098004/)


## Data

The data for this project will be taken from GEO, [Series GSE153875](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153875), for the CHiP-seq data and the raw RNA-seq data [Series GSE159699](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA670209&o=acc_s%3Aa). 

This includes ChIP-seq data for H3K27ac, H3K9ac, H3K122ac and H3K4me1 as well as RNA-seq data from the
from the lateral temporal lobe of the human brain for young healthy patients, old heathy patients and patients with Alzheimers disease.
