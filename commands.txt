
The “reference-point” method is commonly used before plotting the signal around the transcription start site. A reference point ("reference-point") is used to compute the signal distribution
--regionsFileName, -R
--scoreFileName, -S

#All the below commands were executed in Terminal
Plotting the signal distribution over exons or other feature types. Scale-regions ("scale-regions") is used to compute the signal distribution across an area. 
computeMatrix scale-regions \

#PlotCorrelation using multiBamSummary,where it computes the read coverages for genomic regions for typically two or more BAM files.
#--bamfiles, -b--> List of indexed bam files separated by spaces. First, all the bam files should be indexed using below command.

     -parallel  samtools index ::: *.bam


The standard output of multiBamSummary is a compressed numpy array (.npz). The analysis performed for the entire genome by running the program in ‘bins’ mode.

     -multiBamSummary bins --bamfiles *.bam -o readcounts.npz


#plotCorrelation computes the overall similarity between two or more files based on read coverage (or other scores) within genomic regions, 
#which was calculated using multiBamSummarySpearman correlation coefficients of read counts. The dendrogram indicates which samples’ read counts are most similar to each other.
